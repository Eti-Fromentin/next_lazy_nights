This is a re-creation of our 2nd Project @ Wild Code School in Paris: [Lazy Nights](https://github.com/Eti-Fromentin/Lazy_Nigths_front), originally made with love and sweat by [Sophie](https://github.com/sophielepert) [Vincenzo](https://github.com/Vinz19) and me. 

This was made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), some bugs disappeared, some new appeared. 
The (almost) final product can be seen [here](https://lazy-nights.vercel.app/) (mobile only).
